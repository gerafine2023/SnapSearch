# SnapSearch
SnapSearch is not your ordinary screen capture tool; it’s an advanced solution designed to enhance organization, efficiency, and searchability of your images. The application transcends conventional image capturing by embedding extracted text data directly into the file’s properties, transforming every snapshot into a searchable resource.

Efficient Information Gathering:
With SnapSearch, every image you capture is a potential data mine. Texts within images are meticulously extracted and stored as part of the file’s name and properties. This means that all the valuable information within your snapshots is readily available and searchable, directly from the image’s description in its properties/details section.

Enhanced Search Capabilities:
The power of SnapSearch shines when you utilize its advanced search tool. By embedding long text strings from the images, SnapSearch allows users to search and locate images based on content, even if they can’t recall specific filenames. Users can make educated guesses about the image’s content, significantly enhancing the likelihood of locating the desired snapshot.
